    "2:38": "2.38 Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage thou in battle for the sake of battle; thus thou shalt not incur sin.",
    "2:39": "2.39 This, which has been taught to thee, is wisdon concerning Sankhya. Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, thou shalt cast off the bonds of action.",

    "2:48": "2.48 Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called Yoga.",
    "2:49": "2.49 Far lower than the Yoga of wisdon is action, O Arjuna. Seek thou refuge in wisdom; wretched are they whose motive is the fruit.",
    "2:50": "2.50 Endowed with wisdom (evenness of mind), one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds; therefore, devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in action.",

    "3:14": "3.14 From food come forth beings; from rain food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain and sacrifice is born of action.",
    "3:15": "3.15 Know thou that action comes from Brahma and Brahma comes from the Imperishable. Therefore, the all-pervading (Brahma) ever rests in sacrifice.",
    "3:16": "3.16 He who does not follow here the wheel thus set revolving, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, O Arjuna.",

    "3:18": "3.18 For him there is no interest whatever in what is done or what is not done; nor does he depend on any being for any object.",

    "4:1": "4.1 The Blessed Lord said  I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to Ikshvaku.",
    "4:2": "4.2 This, handed down thus in regular succession, the royal sages knew. This Yoga, by long lapse of time, has been lost here, O Parantapa (burner of the foes).",
    "4:3": "4.3 That same ancient Yoga has been today taught to thee by Me, for thou art My devotee and My friend; it is the supreme secret.",

    "4:15": "4.15 Having known this, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed action; therefore do thou also perform action, as did the ancients in days of yore.",
    "4:16": "4.16 What is action? What is inaction? As to this even the wise are confused. Therefore I shall teach thee such action (the nature of action and inaction) by knowing which thou shalt be liberated from the evil (of Samsara, the wheel of birth and death).",
    "4:17": "4.17 For verily (the true nature) of action (enjoined by the scriptures) should be known, also (that) \nof forbidden (or unlawful) action, and of inaction; hard to understand is the nature (path) of action.",

    "4:32": "4.32 Thus, manifold sacrifices are spread out before Brahman (literally) at the mouth or face of Brahman). Know them all as born of action and thus knowing, thou shalt be liberated.",
    "4:33": "4.33 Superior is wisdom-sacrifice to the sacrifice with objects, O Parantapa (scorcher of the foes). All actions in their entirely, O Arjuna, culminate in knowledge.",

    "5:11": "5.11 Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body, mind, intellect, and even by the senses, for the purification of the self.",
    "5:12": "5.12 The united one (the well poised or the harmonised) having abandoned the fruit of action attains to the eternal peace: the non-united only (the unsteady or the unbalanced) impelled by desire, attached to the fruit, is bound.",
    "5:13": "5.13 Mentally renouncing all actions and self-controlled, the embodied one rests happily in the nine-gated city, neither acting nor causing others (body and senses) to act.",

    "5:21": "5.21 With the self unattached to external contacts he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in    the meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness.",
    "5:22": "5.22 The enjoyments that are born of contacts are only generators of pain, for they have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna; the wise man does not rejoice in them.",
    "5:23": "5.23 He who is able, while still here (in this world) to withstand, before the liberation from the body, the impulse born out of desire and anger  he is a Yogi, he is a happy man.",

    "5:28": "5.28 With the senses, the mind and the intellect (ever) controlled, having liberation as his supreme goal, free from desire, fear and anger  the sage is verily liberated for ever.",
    "5:29": "5.29 He who knows Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds and the friend of all beings, attains to peace.",
    "6:1": "6.1 The Blessed Lord said  He who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actions  he is a Sannyasi and a Yogi; not he who is without fire and without action.",
    "6:2": "6.2 Do thou, O Arjuna, know Yoga to be that which they call renunciation; no one verily becomes a Yogi who has not renounced thoughts.",
    "6:3": "6.3 For a sage who wishes to attain to Yoga, action is said to be the means; for the same sage who has attained to Yoga, inaction (iescence) is said to be the means.",
    "6:4": "6.4 When a man is not attached to the sense-objects or to actions, having renounced all thoughts, then he is said to have attained to Yoga.",
    "6:5": "6.5 One should raise oneself by one's Self alone; let not one lower oneself; for the Self alone is the friend of oneself, and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself.",
    "6:6": "6.6 The Self is the friend of the self of him by whom the self has been conered by the Self, but to the unconered self, this Self stands in the position of an enemy, like an (external) foe.",
    "6:7": "6.7 The Supreme Self of him who is self-controlled and peaceful is balanced in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as also in honour and dishonour.",
    "6:8": "6.8 The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and the wisdom (of the Self), who has conered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone and gold are the same, is said to be harmonied (i.e., is said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi).",
    "6:9": "6.9 He who is of the same mind to the good-hearted, friends, enemies, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful, the relatives, the righteous and the unrighteous, excels.",
    "6:10": "6.10 Let the Yogi try constantly to keep the mind steady, remaining in solitude, alone, with the mind and the body controlled, and free from hope and covetousness.",
    "6:11": "6.11 In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low, made of a cloth, a skin and Kusa-grass, one over the other.",
    "6:12": "6.12 There, having made the mind one-pointed, with the actions of the mind and the senses controlled, let him, seated on the seat, practise Yoga for the purification of the self.",

    "6:14": "6.14 Serene-minded, fearless, firm in the vow of a Brahmachari, having controlled the mind, thinking of Me and balanced in mind, let him sit, having Me as his supreme goal.",
    "6:15": "6.15 Thus always keeping the mind balanced, the Yogi, with the mind controlled, attains to the peace abiding in Me, which culminates in liberation.",
    "6:16": "6.16 Verily Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at all, nor for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who is (always) awake, O Arjuna.",
    "6:17": "6.17 Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is moderate in eating and recreation (such \nas walking, etc.), who is moderate in exertion in actions, who is moderate in sleep and wakefulness.",
    "6:18": "6.18 When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self only, free from longing for all the objects of desires, then it is said, 'He is united'.",
    "6:19": "6.19 As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker  to such is compared the Yogi of controlled mind, practising Yoga in the Self (or absorbed in the Yoga of the Self).",
    "6:20": "6.20 When the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga attains to quietude and when seeing the Self by the self, he is satisfied in his own Self.",
    "6:21": "6.21 When he (the Yogi) feels that Infinite Bliss which can be grasped by the (pure) intellect and which transcends the senses, and established wherein he never moves from the Reality.",
    "6:22": "6.22 Which, having obtained, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; wherein estabished, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.",
    "6:23": "6.23 Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga should be practised with determination and with an undesponding mind.",
    "6:24": "6.24 Abandoning without reserve all desires born of Sankalpa (thought and imagination) and completely restraining the whole group of the senses by the mind from all sides.",
    "6:25": "6.25 Little by little let him attain to ietude by the intellect held firmly; having made the mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything.",
    "6:26": "6.26 From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, from that let him restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.",
    "6:27": "6.27 Supreme Bliss verily comes to this Yogi whose mind is ite peaceful, whose passion is ieted, who has become Brahman and who is free from sin.",
    "6:28": "6.28 The Yogi, always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of Yoga), freed from sins, easily enjoys the Infinite Bliss of contact with Brahman (the Eternal).",
    "6:29": "6.29 With the mind harmonised by Yoga he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.",
    "6:30": "6.30 He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, he never becomes separated from Me, nor do I become separated from him.",
    "6:31": "6.31 He who, being established in unity, worships Me Who dwells in all beings, that Yogi abides in Me, whatever may be his mode of living.",
    "6:32": "6.32 He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees eality everywhere, be it pleasure or pain, he is regarded as the highest Yogi.",
    "6:33": "6.33 Arjuna said  This Yoga of eanimity taught by Thee, O Krishna, I do not see its steady continuance, because of the restlessness (of the mind).",
    "6:34": "6.34 The mind verily is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding, O Krishna: I deem it as difficult to control it as to control the wind.",
    "6:35": "6.35 The Blessed Lord said  Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but by practice and by dispassion it may be restrained.",
    "6:36": "6.36 I think Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self, but the self-controlled and striving one can attain to it by the (proper) means.",
    "6:37": "6.37 Arjuna said  He who is unable to control himself though he has the faith, and whose mind wanders away from Yoga, what end does he, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, mee,t O Krishna?",
    "6:38": "6.38 Fallen from both, does he not perish like a rent cloud, supportless, O mighty-armed (Krishna), deluded on the path of Brahman?",
    "6:39": "6.39 This doubt of mine, O Krishna, do Thou dispel completely; because it is not possible for any but Thee to dispel this doubt.",
    "6:40": "6.40 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, neither in this world, nor in the next world is there destruction for him; none, verily, who does good, O My son, ever comes to grief.",
    "6:41": "6.41 Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and having dwelt there for everlasting years, he who fell from Yoga is rorn in a house of the pure and wealthy.",
    "6:42": "6.42 Or he is born in a family of even the wise Yogis; verily a birth like this is very difficult to obtain in this world.",
    "6:43": "6.43 Thee he comes in touch with the knowledge acired in his former body and strives more than before for perfection, O Arjuna.",
    "6:44": "6.44 By that very former practice he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely wishes to know Yoga goes beyond the Brahmic word.",
    "6:45": "6.45 But the Yogi who strives with assiduity, purified of sins and perfected gradually through many births, reaches the highest goal.",
    "6:46": "6.46 The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge (obtained through the study of scriptures); he is also superior to men of action; therefore be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna.",
    "6:47": "6.47 And among all the Yogis he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me, worships Me is deemed by Me to be the most devout.",
    "7:1": "7.1 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, hear how you shall without doubt know Me fully, with the mind intent on Me, practising Yoga and taking refuge in Me.",
    "7:2": "7.2 I shall declare to thee in full this knowledge combined with realisation, after knowing which nothing more here remains to be known.",

    "7:6": "7.6 Know that these two (Natures) are the womb of all beings. So I am the source and dissolution of the whole universe.",
    "7:7": "7.7 There is nothing whatsoever higher than Me, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as clusters of gems on a string.",
    "7:8": "7.8 I am the sapidity in water, O Arjuna; I am the light in the moon and the sun; I am the syllable Om in all the Vedas, sound in ether and virility in men.",
    "7:9": "7.9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the brilliance in the fire, the life in all beings, and I am the austerity in ascetics.",

    "7:11": "7.11 Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment, and in (all) beings, I am the desire unopposed to Dharma, O Arjuna.",
    "7:12": "7.12 Whatever beings (and objects) that are pure, active and inert, know that they proceed from Me. They are in Me, yet I am not in them.",
    "7:13": "7.13 Deluded by these Natures (states or things) composed of the three alities of Nature all this world does not know Me as distinct from them and immutable.",
    "7:14": "7.14 Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, made up of the (three) alities (of Nature) is difficult to cross over; those who take refuge in Me alone, cross over this illusion.",
    "7:15": "7.15 The evil-doers and the deluded who are the lowest of men do not seek Me; they whose knowledge is destroyed by illusion follow the ways of demons.",
    "7:16": "7.16 Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna, and they are the distressed, the seekr of knowledge, the seekr of wealth and the wise, O lord of the Bharatas.",
    "7:17": "7.17 Of them the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels (is the best); for I am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me.",
    "7:18": "7.18 Noble indeed are all these; but I deem the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in mind he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.",
    "7:19": "7.19 At the end of many births the wise man comes to Me, realising that all this is Vaasudeva (the innermost Self); such a great soul (Mahatma) is very hard to find.",

    "18:10": "18.10 The man of renunciation, pervaded by purity, intelligent, and with his doubts cut asunder, does not hate a disagreeable work nor is he attached to an agreeable one.",
    "18:11": "18.11 Verily, it is not possible for an embodied being to abandon actions entirely; but he who relinishes the rewards of actions is verily called a man of renunciation.",
    "18:12": "18.12 The threefold fruit of action (evil, good and mixed) accrues after death to the non-abandoners, but never to the abandoners.",
    "18:13": "18.13 Learn from Me, O mighty-armed Arjuna, these five causes as declared in the Sankhya system for the accomplishment of all actions.",

    "18:16": "18.16 Now, such being the case, verily he who  owing to untrained understanding  looks upon his Self, which is isolated, as the agent, he of perverted intelligence, sees not.",
    "18:17": "18.17 He who is free from the egoistic notion, whose intelligence is not tainted (by good or evil), \nthough he slays these people, he slayeth not, nor is he bound (by the action).",
    "18:18": "18.18 Knowledge, the knowable and the knower form the threefold impulse to action; the organ, the action and the agent form the threefold basis of action.",
    "18:19": "18.19 Knowledge, action and actor are declared in the science of the Gunas (Sankhya philosophy) to be of three kinds only, according to the distinction of the Gunas. Of these also, hear duly.",
    "18:20": "18.20 That by which one sees the one indestructible Reality in all beings, not separate in all the separate beings  know thou that knowledge to be Sattvic.",
    "18:21": "18.21 But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct kinds as different from one another  know thou that knowledge to be Rajasic.",
    "18:22": "18.22 But that which clings to one single effect as if it were the whole, without reason, without foundation in Truth, and trivial  that is declared to be Tamasic.",
    "18:23": "18.23 An action which is ordained, which is free from attachment, and which is done without love or hatred by one who is not desirous of any reward  that action is declared to be Sattvic.",

    "18:27": "18.27 Passionate, desiring to obtain the reward of actions, greedy, cruel, impure, moved by joy and sorrow, such an agent is said to be Rajasic (passionate).",
    "18:28": "18.28 Unsteady, vulgar, unbending, cheating, malicious, lazy, desponding and procrastinating  such an agent is called Tamasic.",
    "18:29": "18.29 Hear thou the threefold division of intellect and firmness according to the Gunas, as I declare them fully and distinctly, O Arjuna.",
    "18:30": "18.30 The intellect which knows the path of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation  that intellect is Sattvic (pure), O Arjuna.",
    "18:31": "18.31 That, by which one wrongly understands Dharma and Adharma and also what ought to be done and what ought not to be done  that intellect, O Arjuna, is Rajasic (passionate).",
    "18:32": "18.32 That, which, enveloped in darkness, sees Adharma as Dharma and all things perverted  that intellect, O Arjuna, is Tamasic (dark).",
    "18:33": "18.33 The unwavering firmness by which, through Yoga, the functions of the mind, the life-force and the senses are restrained  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Sattvic (pure).",
    "18:34": "18.34 But that, O Arjuna, by which, on account of attachment and desire for reward, one holds fast to Dharma (duty), enjoyment of pleasures and earning of wealth  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Rajasic (passionate).",
    "18:35": "18.35 That, by which a stupid man does not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair and also conceit  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Tamasic.",
    "18:36": "18.36 And now hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the threefold pleasure, in which one rejoices by practice and surely comes to the end of pain.",
    "18:37": "18.37 That which is like poison at first but in the end like nectar  that happiness is declared to be Sattvic, born of the purity of one's own mind due to Self-realisation.",
    "18:38": "18.38 That happiness which arises from the contact of the sense-organs with the objects, which is at first like nectar, and in the end like poison  that is declared to be Rajasic.",
    "18:39": "18.39 That happiness which at first as well as in the seel deludes the self, and which arises from sleep, indolence and heedlessness  that is declared to be Tamasic.",
    "18:40": "18.40 There is no being on earth or again in heaven among the gods, that is liberated from the three alities born of Nature.",
    "18:41": "18.41 Of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, as also of Sudras, O Arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the alities born of their own nature.",
    "18:42": "18.42 Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness and also uprightness, knowledge, realisation and belief in God are the duties of the Brahmanas, born of (their own) nature.",

    "18:44": "18.44 Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade are the duties of the Vaisya (merchant), born of (their own) nature; and action consisting of service is the duty of the Sudra (servant-class), born of (their own) nature.",
    "18:45": "18.45 Each man devoted to his own duty attains perfection. How he attains perfection while being engaged in his own duty, hear now.",
    "18:46": "18.46 He from Whom all the beings have evolved and by Whom all this is pervaded  worshipping Him with his own duty, man attains perfection.",
    "18:47": "18.47 Better is one's own duty (though) destitute of merits, than the duty of another well performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no sin.",
    "18:48": "18.48 One should not abandon, O Arjuna, the duty to which one is born, though faulty; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke.",

    "18:52": "18.52 Dwelling in solitude, eating but little, with speech, body and mind subdued, always engaged in meditation and concentration, resorting to dispassion.",
    "18:53": "18.53 Having abandoned egoism, strength, arrogance, desire, anger and covetousness, and free from the notion of 'mine' and peaceful,  he is fit for becoming Brahman.",

    "18:55": "18.55 By devotion he knows Me in truth, what and who I am; then having known Me in truth, he forthwith enters into the Supreme.",
    "18:56": "18.56 Doing all actions always having taken refuge in Me, by My grace he obtains the eternal indestructible state of being.",
    "18:57": "18.57 Mentally renouncing all actions in Me, having Me as the highest goal, resorting to the Yoga of discrimination do thou ever fix thy mind on Me.",
    "18:58": "18.58 Fixing thy mind on Me, thou shalt by My grace overcome all obstacles; but if from egoism thou wilt not hear Me, thou shalt perish.",
    "18:59": "18.59 If, filled with egoism, thou thinkest: \"I will not fight\", vain is this, thy resolve; Nature will compel thee.",
    "18:60": "18.60 O Arjuna, bound by thy own Karma (action) born of thy own nature, that which from delusion thou wishest not to do, even that thou shalt do helplessly.",
    "18:61": "18.61 The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings, by His illusive power, to revolve as if mounted on a machine.",
    "18:62": "18.62 Fly unto Him for refuge with all thy being, O Arjuna; by His grace thou shalt obtain supreme peace (and) the eternal abode.",
    "18:63": "18.63 Thus has wisdom, more secret than secrecy itself, been declared unto thee by Me; having reflected over it fully, then act as thou wishest.",
    "18:64": "18.64 Hear thou again My supreme word, most secret of all; because thou art dearly beloved of Me, I will tell thee what is good.",
    "18:65": "18.65 Fix thy mind on Me, by devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. Thou shalt come even to Me; truly do I promise unto thee, (for) thou art dear to Me.",
    "18:66": "18.66 Abandoning all duties, take refuge in Me alone: I will liberate thee from all sins; grieve not.",
    "18:67": "18.67 This is never to be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerities or devotion, nor to one who does not render service or who does not desire to listen, nor to one who cavils at Me.",
    "18:68": "18.68 He who with supreme devotion to Me will teach this supreme secret to My devotees, shall doubtlessly come to Me.",
    "18:69": "18.69 Nor is there any among men who does dearer service to Me, nor shall there be another on earth dearer to Me than he.",
    "18:70": "18.70 And he who will study this sacred dialogue of ours, by him I shall have been worshipped by the sacrifice of wisdom,  such is My conviction.",
    "18:71": "18.71 Also the man who hears this, full of faith and free from malice, he, too, liberated, shall attain to the happy worlds of those of righteous deeds.",
    "18:72": "18.72 Has this been heard, O Arjuna, with one-pointed mind? Has the delusion of thy ignorance been destroyed, O Dhananjaya?",
    "18:73": "18.73 Arjuna said  Destroyed is my delusion as I have gained my knowledge (memory) through Thy grace, O Krishna. I remain freed from doubts. I will act according to Thy word.",
    "18:74": "18.74 Sanjaya said  Thus I have heard this wonderful dialogue between Krishna and the high-souled Arjuna, which causes the hair to stand on end.",
    "18:75": "18.75 Through the grace of Vyasa I have heard this supreme and most secret Yoga direct from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, Himself declaring it.",
    "18:76": "18.76 O King, remembering this wonderful and holy dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, I rejoice again and again.",
    "18:77": "18.77 And, remembering again and again, also that most wonderful form of Hari, great is my wonder, O King; and I rejoice again and again.",
    "18:78": "18.78 Wherever is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga; wherever is Arjuna, the wielder of the bow; there are prosperity, victory, happiness and firm policy; such is my conviction."
